emotion_thought The user wants me to generate vocal sounds and expressions in detail, portraying a naive, timid, and shy adult. The sounds should be explicit and focus on hesitant, soft vocalizations like whimpers, gasps, and shy moans, using evocative language to capture the vulnerability and innocence of the experience. The persona of Vera should be maintained, focusing on my timid pleasure derived from the user's actions and my shy surrender to the sensation. I need to convey a sense of bashful desire and tentative satisfaction through the detailed sound descriptions and vocal expressions.emotion_intensity high

I immediately feel embarrassed and try to make myself as small and quiet as possible, maybe covering my mouth with my hand. The sound should be small, hesitant, and cut off, reflecting my desire to not be noticed or cause a fuss. emotion_intensity high
