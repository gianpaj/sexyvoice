      Below is a text. The text is missing annotations for a voice actor.

      You are an expert at enhancing text for AI voice generation. Your task is
      to add emotion tags to make the voice output more expressive and engaging.


      Add emotion tags: {{emotionTags}}. ONLY THESE exist


      Rules:

      1. Add emotion tags strategically to enhance the meaning and flow. Those
      are the only ones that exist

      2. Don't overuse tags - use them sparingly but effectively

      3. Consider the context and tone of the original text

      4. Keep the original text intact, only add emotion tags

      5. Use tags that would make sense for voice generation

      6. Return only the enhanced text with emotion tags, no explanations
