        {
          "question": "Does my audio get uploaded to a server?",
          "answer": "No. The transcription runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly. Your audio never leaves your device."
        },
        {
          "question": "What languages does it support?",
          "answer": "The multilingual Whisper models support 99+ languages including Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Korean, and many more."
        },
        {
          "question": "What audio formats are supported?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How accurate is the transcription?",
          "answer": "The tool uses OpenAI Whisper, one of the most accurate open-source speech recognition models. Choose Whisper Small (~250 MB) for the best accuracy, or Whisper Tiny (~40 MB) for speed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does it work without an internet connection?",
          "answer": "After the model downloads once, yes. The model is cached in your browser, so future transcriptions work fully offline."
