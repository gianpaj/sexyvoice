          "question": "Is my voice data secure?",
          "answer": "Yes. We encrypt all voice data and store it securely. You control your audio generations completely and can delete them anytime. We never share your voice data with others without your permission. Your privacy is our priority."

        },
        {
          "question": "What languages do you support?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Can I make a voice speak with a specific accent or style, like British or pirate?",
          "answer": "Yes! Choose a multilingual voice (for example, Zephyr) and add your instruction in the style box, like: 'Speak with a British accent' or 'Speak like a pirate.' The voice will instantly adapt. You can use this for accents, character voices, or unique speaking styles—experiment with different prompts until you find the perfect fit."
