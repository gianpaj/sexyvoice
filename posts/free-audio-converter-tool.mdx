## Convert Audio Without Leaving Your Browser

Got a WAV that’s too large, an OGG your phone won’t play, or an M4A your editor won’t accept? Most converters ask you to upload the file, wait in a queue, and hope it comes back intact.

This tool skips it. Drop a file, pick a format, and download the result. It runs in your browser.

## Why In-Browser Conversion Matters

When you upload a file to an online converter, a stranger's server handles it. Your recordings — interviews, music drafts, voice memos — sit on hardware you don't control, processed by code you can't inspect.

This tool runs [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) directly in your browser via WebAssembly. Conversion runs on your machine. Once the tool loads, it works without an internet connection. Your files stay private.

## How It Works

Three steps:

1. **Drop your file.** Drag and drop any audio file onto the tool, or click to browse.
2. **Pick a format.** Choose MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC, M4A, or MP4 from the dropdown.
3. **Convert and download.** Watch the progress bar, then save the converted file with one click.

No account required.

The tool shows live progress during conversion. When it finishes, download it immediately.

## Supported Formats

Supported formats:

- **MP3** — universal playback, small file size
- **WAV** — uncompressed, lossless quality
- **AAC** — efficient compression, native to Apple devices
- **OGG** — open format, common in games and web audio
- **FLAC** — lossless compression, preferred by audiophiles
- **M4A** — Apple's container for AAC audio
- **MP4** — video container that holds audio tracks

Convert in any direction. WAV to MP3, FLAC to AAC, OGG to WAV — all combinations work.

## What It Costs

Free. No limits, no credit card, no catch. Built as a public utility—like our [free transcription tool](../tools/transcribe).

## Technical Details

- **Engine:** FFmpeg compiled to WebAssembly — the same tool professionals use on the command line
- **Performance:** Runs on a background thread, so the page stays responsive during conversion

- **Privacy:** Zero network requests during conversion. Fully offline after the initial load.

## Get Started

Open the [audio converter](../tools/audio-converter), drop a file, and pick your format. No sign-up, no waiting, no strings attached.
