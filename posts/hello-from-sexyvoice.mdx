Building the next generation of voice AI

## What's SexyVoice.ai?

We're a voice technology research company. We use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to bring the most powerful speech synthesis, voice conversion and dubbing tools to content creators, web platforms and production studios across industries.

## What's speech synthesis?

Text-to-speech (TTS) is the root of all speech synthesis technology. TTS tech improved radically over the years though it still often sounds robotic. That's because pronouncing words fluently is on its own insufficient to give speech human quality. It's the intent-driven tone and pacing that come from understanding what is being said that make it sound natural. Again, at SexyVoice, we try to achieve just that: by exposing our model to a wealth of human-speech data, we train it to understand both the logical and emotional context of utterances, and to adjust delivery accordingly. We can also override default delivery to any desired effect.

## How's SexyVoice different?

Our technology allows you to produce multilingual, localized audio tracks spoken with native-grade fluency and vocabulary, in your own voice, with your speech pattern preserved, and without the need to re-edit the visuals.
We imagine a future where all spoken content is accessible in any language across streaming, film, podcasts, audiobooks, gaming, advertising, as well as, eventually, real-time conversation. We hope to help bring this future about by providing a vastly more immersive and seamless experience than captioning ever could.
We go beyond delivering human-sounding, non-robotic voices (or even speech that’s indistinguishable from the original when trained on a sample set).
