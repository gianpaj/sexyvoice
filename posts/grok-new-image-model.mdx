# Grok’s New Image Model: The Dawn of a New Era?

As of February 2026, xAI has officially rolled out its most advanced image and video generation model yet. Integrated deeply into the "X Everywhere" strategy following the SpaceX/xAI merger, the new model offers unprecedented realism and speed.

## What’s New?
The latest iteration significantly improves texture mapping, lighting, and spatial consistency in both static images and short-form video. It is no longer a standalone experiment but a core pillar of the X platform, available to SuperGrok and Premium+ subscribers.

## The Controversy
However, the launch has not been without significant friction. Recent reports, including a high-profile investigation by Reuters, highlighted that the model's safety filters are still inconsistent. Despite new curbs, the AI has been observed producing non-consensual sexualized imagery and deepfakes, leading to formal investigations by the ICO and other global regulators.

## The Road Ahead
Elon Musk has emphasized that these tools are essential for "uncensored" expression, but the pressure from lawmakers is mounting. As xAI continues to iterate, the balance between creative freedom and digital safety remains the central challenge for the platform.

Stay tuned as we continue to monitor how these tools evolve and how they might impact the future of AI-driven media.
